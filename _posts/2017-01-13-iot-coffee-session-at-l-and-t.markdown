The objective of the session was to give business leaders a mental model to analyse the technology and assess its suitability for their business.

**About Internet of Things**

Sensors, networks and machines evolved since the industrial revolution. IOT is a continuation to connect machines and networks to people. Data feed from machines help engineers take better decisions and open new business streams. However, the speed of change is so rapid that it creates a lot of complexities and noise in the marketplace.

"Internet of Things is not about sensors or data collected or the network used. It is about making sense of the data to
convert to meaningful actions"

Swapnil Amritkar, COO - Entrib Technologies
