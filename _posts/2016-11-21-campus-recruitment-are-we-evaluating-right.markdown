Young graduates bring in fresh insights and a lot of enthusiasm with their willingness to experiment and think out of the box. They feed their organization’s innovation engine and are strategically significant for its growth. Most organizations use marks, aptitude test, technical test and an interview to hire graduates. Graduates often prefer certain job profiles based on limited industry exposure.

The good news is there is a way to go beyond preferences and standard evaluation process to find candidates based on their skills. Experiential evaluation is the future of hiring.

What is experiential evaluation?

Gather 60 of your potential employees in a room and give them a real world problem to solve. If you are an automotive component supplier, ask them to prototype an automatic head lamp system for a car. Give them all the necessary resources to design and develop a bench prototype. With developer boards and open sourcing, it takes very little time (\~ 4 hours) and investment to execute.

This experiential hiring process allows both the company and the candidate to essentially test drive before committing. Company gets an opportunity to judge candidate‘s ability that no amount of marks, paper tests and generic answers to “what are your three best qualities?” can replicate. To form meaningful opinions about candidates; you need to give them an opportunity to perform.

And, this isn’t limited to engineers or technical profiles. Experiential evaluation could include anything from redesigning a social media campaign to editing a keynote presentation or expanding a product catalog!
