We help organizations set up Digital Foundry to help clients experience the capabilities of emerging technologies. 

Digital Foundry will provide hands-on environment and real world demonstration zones. Clients bring in their industry problems and work with digital experts to create ‘proof of concepts’, reducing the development time from months to days.

Predictive maintenance of critical machines using IoT, aerial monitoring of solar power plants using drones, VR/AR experience center are some of the zones in a Digital Foundry.
