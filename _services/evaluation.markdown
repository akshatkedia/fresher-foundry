Random allocation of graduate trainee engineers is often ineffective. Also, graduates are biased towards popular profiles such as R&D or Design. It is vital to match a graduate's competencies to relevant areas in order to enhance productivity.

We create one day sessions where new hires solve engineering problems and are assessed by experts on how they fared in profile specific challenges. We produce a comprehensive evaluation report which is used by organizations to achieve candidate - profile fit (likely to result in lower attrition).
