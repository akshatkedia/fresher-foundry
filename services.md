    We help business leaders demystify new technologies and capture their benefits over a cup of coffee.  We curate and customize technology sessions for your business. Our goal is not to predict the future, but give business leaders a mental model to analyse the technology and assess its suitability for their business.

    Drones, IoT, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, virtual reality are few transformative technologies we have identified. But, the list keeps changing with time.

    After establishing a need to adopt an emerging technology, we conduct two to five day sessions for practicing engineers to gain working knowledge of the technology. These sessions are highly engaging and project based.

    The objective of this session is to enable the engineer to use the technology to develop prototypes for problems at work.

    The first step to pilot emerging technologies is to create an ecosystem for the engineers to pick problems around them and build solutions.

    We help organizations set up labs - right from need analysis, determining the space, equipment selection to validation and training. The right expertise can save considerable expense and time, and ensure that the lab is productive.

- name: Evaluation
  description: |-
    Random allocation of graduate trainee engineers is often ineffective. Also, graduates are biased towards popular profiles such as R&D or Design. It is vital to match a graduate's competencies to relevant areas in order to enhance productivity.

    We create one day sessions where new hires solve engineering problems and are assessed by experts on how they fared in profile specific challenges. We produce an comprehensive evaluation report which is used by organizations to achieve candidate - profile fit (likely to result in lower attrition).
