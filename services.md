    leader to sift through buzzwords and invest in technologies that create real value
    for their business.

    After establishing a need to adopt an emerging technology, we conduct two to five day sessions for practicing engineers to gain working knowledge of the technology. These sessions are highly engaging and project based.

    The objective of this session is to enable the engineer to use the technology to develop prototypes for problems at work.

- name: Evaluation
  description: |-
    Random allocation of graduate trainee engineers is often ineffective. Also, graduates are biased towards popular profiles such as R&D or Design. It is vital to match a graduate's competencies to relevant areas in order to enhance productivity.

    We create one day sessions where new hires solve engineering problems and are assessed by experts on how they fared in profile specific challenges. We produce a comprehensive evaluation report which is used by organizations to achieve candidate - profile fit (likely to result in lower attrition).
