  testimonial: "I strongly believe that if you do what you like then it is passion
    else it is stress. \nFuture Foundry customized a session for us which was pure
    hands-on and had activities specific to different roles like R&D, sales, manufacturing
    and commissioning. Their evaluation report helped us match our engineers to roles
    based on their competency and interest."

  testimonial: Despite the short duration (2.5 hours), Fresher Foundry's technology
    coffee sessions are never surface level. I am impressed with their ability to
    create engaging demonstrations and curate relevant case studies on every technology.
    After their series on industry 4.0, our employees are picking up pilot projects
    to implement.
  company: Vice President, Technical Corporate Training, Larsen & Toubro
  adjective: Engaging, Relevant!
