  testimonial: "I strongly believe that if you do what you like then it is passion
    else it is stress. \n\nFuture Foundry customized a session for us which was pure
    hands-on and had activities specific to different roles like R&D, sales, manufacturing
    and commissioning. Their evaluation report helped us match our engineers to roles
    based on their competency and interest."

  testimonial: "Despite the short duration (2**.**5 hours), Future Foundry's technology
    coffee sessions are never surface level. I am impressed with their ability to
    create engaging demonstrations and curate relevant case studies on every technology.
    \n\nAfter their series on industry 4.0, our employees are picking up pilot projects
    to implement."

    Future Foundry is refreshing in its approach to training. The two day IOT training was pure hands-on, no boring presentations or lectures. Deepak starts every session with an IoT problem and in the process of solving that problem, our faculty learns the concepts.

    What differentiates them is their experience of working with industries which they incorporate in their sessions through projects and examples.I would strongly recommend them to institutions who are looking for robust faculty training.
