    Conferences are generic, vendors are biased

    and POCs are necessary. How do I start?

  testimonial: "Unlike other conferences or tech talks, Tech on Toast provided not
    just an overview of the new technologies, but also live demos and relevant use
    cases for our industry. \n\nThis made it possible for us to immediately start
    exploring ways of using the new technologies to enhance our business. The team's
    ability to curate experts with significant breadth and depth of knowledge is commendable.
    \n\nThey are also able to walk the talk by setting up labs, CoEs and implementing
    IoT projects for our businesses. The enthusiasm and dynamism of team make them
    a valuable partner in our digital journey."

  testimonial: "Despite the short duration (2**.**5 hours), Future Foundry's technology
    coffee sessions are never surface level. I am impressed with their ability to
    create engaging demonstrations and curate relevant case studies on every technology.
    \n\nAfter their series on industry 4.0, our employees are picking up pilot projects
    to implement."

    Future Foundry is refreshing in its approach to training. The two day IOT training was pure hands-on, no boring presentations or lectures. Deepak starts every session with an IoT problem and in the process of solving that problem, our faculty learns the concepts.

    What differentiates them is their experience of working with industries which they incorporate in their sessions through projects and examples.I would strongly recommend them to institutions who are looking for robust faculty training.
