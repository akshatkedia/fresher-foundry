history: |-
  Future Foundry (initially, Fresher Foundry) was born out of numerous coffee-conversations in a quiet town in UK. We were working in our dream companies leading a conventional life. Restless souls as we are, few questions bothered us. "How our professional lives could have been better if we were taught differently? Why don't we 'do and learn? How can businesses train engineers better?"

  We started exploring the idea of training engineers on emerging technologies and conducted our first session in July 2014 with a bunch of curious engineers. The session was received so well that we could not resist moving back to India.

  Future Foundry started operating in Mumbai in January 2015. Since then we have designed experiential solutions that have impacted 2000+ decision makers and practicing engineers in India.
approach: "We believe in the power of learning by doing. All our services are built
  around experiential learning. \n\nNo presentations, no lectures, no tests! From
  the shortest coffee sessions to the longest 2 week trainings, all our sessions start
  with a real world problem. Engineers learn in the process of solving the problem.\n\nEvery
  session is unique and tailored to address the needs of each client. We collaborate
  with technical consultants to design and deliver customized solutions for various
  technologies like IOT, Big Data, Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence etc."
