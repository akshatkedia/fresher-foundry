history: "Future Foundry (initially, Fresher Foundry) was born out of numerous coffee-conversations
  in a quiet town in UK. We were working in our dream companies leading a conventional
  life. Restless souls as we are, few questions bothered us. \"Why are companies like
  Google, Amazon are quick to adopt emerging technologies while others are reluctant?
  What stops business leaders from quickly evaluating and adopting an emerging technology?
  Why are Indian conglomerates behind their western counterparts\"\n\nWe started speaking
  to business leaders across organizations Siemens, L&T and realized that evaluating
  an emerging technology is a daunting task in an industry drowning in buzzwords.
  Relevant, curated and unbiased information is difficult to access but the cost of
  not taking a decision is very high. It is a real, exciting problem and we decided
  to solve it. \n\nFuture Foundry started operating in Mumbai in January 2015. Since
  then we have designed sessions and solutions that have impacted 200+ decision makers
  in 7+ conglomerates in India."
